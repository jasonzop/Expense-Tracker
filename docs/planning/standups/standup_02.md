# Standup - Week 2

## What I Completed
- [x] Planned React component architecture
- [x] Built ExpenseCard, Header, ExpenseSummary, and ExpenseList components
- [x] Implemented state management with useState in App.tsx
- [x] Added ExpenseForm with validation and controlled inputs
- [x] Connected components with centralized data flow
- [x] Updated project UI with category filter and expense totals

## What I'm Working On
- [ ] Adding form validation improvements and error handling
- [ ] Tailwind CSS integration for consistent styling
- [ ] Practicing Git workflow and commit standards

## Blockers
- Styling inconsistencies until Tailwind setup
- Minor date offset bug (fixed by switching to local date)

## Learning Goals This Week
- Deepen understanding of props vs state
- Practice controlled form components
- Improve professional commit practices

## Notes
React fundamentals are becoming clearer. I can now see how professional teams build reusable, modular components and track state effectively.

## [OPTIONAL] AI Usage Reflection
Used AI to debug CSS issues, fix time zone bug, and structure documentation in professional format.
