# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for Type Safety

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to choose between JavaScript and TypeScript for our React application.

### Requirements
- Catch errors early in development
- Improve code maintainability
- Support team collaboration
- Prepare students for industry standards

### Options considered
1. **JavaScript**: Familiar, quick to start, flexible  
2. **TypeScript**: Type safety, better tooling, industry standard

## Decision
We will use TypeScript for all new code in this project.

### Rationale
- Prevents common runtime errors through compile-time checking  
- Improves IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring  
- Industry standard at 78% of companies (State of JS 2024)  
- Better documentation through type definitions  

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime  
- Better IDE support and autocomplete  
- Self-documenting code through type definitions  
- Easier refactoring and maintenance  
- Industry-relevant skill development  

**Negative:**
- Initial learning curve for newcomers  
- Additional build complexity compared to plain JavaScript  
- Slightly longer development time for simple features  
- Need to learn type definitions for third-party libraries  

### Mitigation
- Start with basic TypeScript features and gradually adopt advanced patterns  
- Provide TypeScript resources and support during team learning  
- Use `any` type sparingly for quick prototyping
