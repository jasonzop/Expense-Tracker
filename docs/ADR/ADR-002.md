# ADR-002: Component-Based Architecture in React

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Context
The Expense Tracker project needs a scalable, modular UI system. Using React with TypeScript allows us to break down the application into reusable components that handle their own responsibilities (e.g., Header, ExpenseCard, ExpenseSummary, ExpenseForm, ExpenseList).

**Requirements:**
- Components must be reusable
- State management should follow React best practices
- Clear separation of concerns (UI vs data logic)
- TypeScript interfaces enforce prop safety

**Options considered:**
1. Build everything in a single App component (simple but unscalable)
2. Component-based design with reusable, modular files
3. Use external UI framework (faster, but less control over learning objectives)

## Decision
Option 2: Use component-based design with reusable React components and TypeScript interfaces.

**Rationale:**
- Matches industry best practices
- Easy to test and extend
- Clean separation of UI and state
- Prepares for scaling to full-stack integration

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better maintainability
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Improved readability and modularity

**Negative:**
- Slightly more setup overhead
- Requires consistent folder organization

**Mitigation:**
- Use clear folder structure under `src/components/`
- Document architecture decisions in ADRs
- Keep App.tsx as the single source of truth for state
